  <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> – Already have your hands dirty with Spring? Wondering
how reactive will play along with Spring and how they will shape
each other? Read this book. You will get crushed under the load of
information trying to get covered, but will have no regrets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="cover.jpg" alt="Reactive Programming in Spring 5"></p>

<p>I tend to avoid reading books whose subject is about a certain library
or tool, unless I think it will provide some insight into a certain
domain in addition to the software’s internals. And as you may guess,
many <a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a>-related books do not pass this
test. Though <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-reactive-programming-spring-5">Reactive Programming in Spring
5</a>
was an exception due to following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/OlehDokuka">Oleh Dokuka</a>, one of the two
authors of the book, is a contributor to many Spring projects, in
particular to <a href="http://projectreactor.io/">Reactor</a>. He is further a
pretty active figure in <a href="https://gitter.im/reactor/reactor">Reactor Gitter
channel</a> where he is serving a
fantastic public service. I personally am really interested in
hearing anything he would say about <a href="http://www.reactive-streams.org/">Reactive
Streams</a> in general.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Love it, hate it, but almost the entire Java train is fueled by
Spring framework. In my day to day work, I am swamped into Spring
too. If you would pay close attention, particularly after the recent
<a href="https://springoneplatform.io/2018/sessions">SpringOne 2018</a>, Spring
is full steam moving towards a reactive interface supported by all
its whistles and bells – <a href="http://rsocket.io/">RSocket</a>,
<a href="https://r2dbc.io/">R2DBC</a>, <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/spring-framework-reference/html/web-reactive.html">WebFlux and
WebClient</a>,
Reactor, etc. Though sometimes it is really difficult to see how the
entire machine is progressing given the excessive amount of
sub-projects. I expected the book to provide a 2,000 ft overview to
the roadmap of this beast.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

<p>If you are dealing with Spring while taking your daily dose of Java,
<strong>read this book!</strong> The book manages to deliver an outstanding
coverage of both reactive streams and its integration to almost all of
the existing Spring components. In a nutshell, it lays out the
following subjects in order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fundamentals of reactive programming (observer pattern)</li>
  <li>its historical development in the presence of RxJava, Reactive Streams, and Reactor</li>
  <li>pull, push, and pull-push streaming</li>
  <li>backpressure</li>
  <li>theoratical foundations of reactive programming (Little’s and Amdahl’s laws)</li>
  <li>WebFlux versus Web MVC</li>
  <li>introduction to Reactor</li>
  <li>reactive
    <ul>
      <li>Spring Data</li>
      <li>Spring Cloud Stream</li>
      <li>Spring Cloud Flow</li>
      <li>Spring Boot</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>RSocket</li>
  <li>testing</li>
  <li>deployment to cloud</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, authors did a splendid job in compiling an exhaustive
content covering almost every aspect of reactive programming in Spring
5. They possess an in-depth understanding of the material they are
talking about and present it in a digestable form to the user. While
this thick compilation has the potential of crushing the reader, it is
definitely a rewarding read.</p>

<h2 id="pros">Pros</h2>

<p>After finishing the book, a cover-to-cover marathon of 538 pages, I
felt like I know everything there is to know about reactive
programming in Spring.</p>

<p><img src="i-know.jpg" alt="I know reactive Spring!"></p>

<p>The extent of the covered content was astonishingly huge. I knew about
RxJava, Reactive Streams, and Reactor individually, but not how they
relate to each other. The presented historical perspective cleared out
the missing pieces of the puzzle for me. I really enjoyed how the
prose builds up by examining the problem, introducing the solution,
laying out caveats of certain approaches, and drawing real-world
comparisons. They repeated this pragmatic pattern for almost any
project (Reactor, WebFlux, Spring Data, Spring Cloud Stream, etc.)
they introduced.</p>

<p>I was not expecting an in-depth Reactor content, though the authors
delivered a perfect job here given the book’s main subject is not just
Reactor.</p>

<p>Investigation of pull, push, pull-push streaming, stress of
backpressure, and reinforcement of the content with some theory
(Little’s and Amdahl’s laws) was pretty enlightening to read. While
many would consider these subjects boring, I found it pretty
interesting and practical.</p>

<h2 id="cons">Cons</h2>

<p>The book is too long to a point of becoming exhausting. Many material
(Vert.x, Ratpack integration, Reactive Streams TCK, transactions in
distributed messaging systems, etc.) could have been left out and then
the main juice would fit into ~300 pages. Even then, it is still
long. I would have split the book into two: <em>Project Reactor in
Action</em> and <em>Reactive Programming in Spring 5</em>. While reading, I also
felt such a split as well.</p>

<p>While 90% of the book is pretty objective, certain subjects were
presented with bias. Particularly, RSocket-vs-gRPC comparison and
using message brokers over system-to-system communication chapters
were really opinionated. (I further explained this problem in my notes
shared below.)</p>

<p>The presented content is always excercised using Apache Kafka and
MongoDB. I suppose this is due to the fact that these two are the only
tools that have almost perfect reactive coverage by Spring family of
projects.</p>

<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>

<p>Below I share my notes ranging from a grammar mistake to a code typo,
incorrect or ambiguous information to a thought provoking know-how,
practical tip, etc. I further classify them in 4 groups:
<span class="note-correction">corrections</span>,
<span class="note-improvement">improvements</span>,
<span class="note-question">questions</span>, and
<span class="note-other">other</span>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-correction">[p11]</span> Shared <code>processRequest()</code>
method is missing a <code>return</code> statement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-correction">[p12]</span> As a coroutine/fiber
fanboy, I could not have passed through the following statement:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In some languages, such as C#, Go, and Kotlin, the same code [a
simple inter-microservice communication over HTTP] might be
non-blocking when green threads are used. However, in pure Java,
we do not have such features yet. Consequently, the actual thread
will be blocked in such cases.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I forgot how many times I needed to correct this false misbelief,
but I will repeat it here one more time: For any language X
compiling to JVM bytecode, if a Java standard library call is
[thread] blocking, access to it in X is going to be blocking as
well. Kotlin coroutines is no exception to this. Further every
convenience X provides, say coroutines, except syntatic sugars, has
already been at the exposure of Java via solid libraries like
<a href="https://github.com/nqzero/kilim">Kilim</a> (since 2006) and
<a href="https://github.com/puniverse/quasar">Quasar</a> (since 2013).</p>

    <p>Additionally, the rules of the game will totally change in a couple
of years after the release of <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/loom/">Project
Loom</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvements">[p16]</span> In Diagram 1.4, what
is the difference between solid and dashed lines? I am surprised to
see that the image is advertising Apache Kafka while the rest of the
components are free from such specification.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvements">[p18]</span> In Diagram 1.5, texts
are not readable. (Unfortunately, many of the image texts are not
readable in the hardcopy. I don’t know about the e-book though.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-correction">[p28]</span> <em>all cross-service

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p46]</span> Justification of why

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-correction">[p59]</span> <em>The <code>count</code> operator is

  <li>
    <p><span class="note-question">[p62]</span> Chapter starts with</p>

    <pre><code class="language-java"><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="nc">SearchEngine</span> <span class="o">{</span>

    <p>interface, improves it with</p>

    <p>After piling up enough motivation, justifies the victory of
<code>Observable</code>s:</p>

<span class="o">}</span></code></pre>

    <p>As a reader, let me ask the obvious question: Why not using a
<code>Stream&lt;URL&gt;</code> return type instead?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-question">[p103]</span> In the following
explanation,</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Note that <code>ScheduledPublisher</code> is effectively an infinite stream
and the completion of the merged <code>Publisher</code> is ignored.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>What does <em>merged <code>Publisher</code></em> refer to? <code>NewsPreparationOperator</code>?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-correction">[p106]</span> <em>Unfortunately, building a
proper test suit</em> → <em>… test suite</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p114]</span> Rather than focusing
this much on the TCK, which is most of the time more relevant for
library authors compared to users, I wish the authors would have had
spared some pages on pitfalls and patterns of processors, which is
bread and butter of reactive stream users and sadly skipped in the
previous chapter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p123-129]</span> I don’t think the
readers really care about reactive streams adjustments for Vert.x,
Ratpack or MongoDB reactive streams driver. I find these pages
irrelevant and distracting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p133]</span> It is page 133 and the
reader is newly getting exposed to Project Reactor. Sort of too
late, I think.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p133]</span> <em>Project Reactor, the
most famous library in the reactive landscape, …</em> Really? Putting
aside I favor Reactor over RxJava, the IT community that I know of
does not give me such an impression to back this claim up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-correction">[p141]</span> <em>investigating its reach
API.</em> → <em>… its rich API</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p149]</span> Speaking of <code>defer()</code>,
it allows retries, which is, I think, of uttermost importance mostly
overlooked by many and aligns better with reactive streams semantic
compliance. Consider the following code:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-java"><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">Mono</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Mono</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">mono</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">Stopwatch</span> <span class="n">stopwatch</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Stopwatch</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">createUnstarted</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">mono</span>
            <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">doOnSubscribe</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ignored</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">stopwatch</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">start</span><span class="o">())</span>
            <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">doOnTerminate</span><span class="o">(()</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">LOGGER</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">log</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"{}"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">stopwatch</span><span class="o">));</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre>

    <p>versus the alternative below</p>

    <pre><code class="language-java"><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">Mono</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Mono</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">mono</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

    <span class="o">});</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre>

    <p>Also this is a good spot to talk about assembly-vs-runtime overhead
of operator chaining.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-correction">[p149]</span> The word wrapping of
paragraph starting with <em>Summing this up, Project reactor allows
…</em> is broken.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-correction">[p150]</span> <em>…, we may still request
<code>Long.MAX_VALUE).</code></em> → <em>request <code>Long.MAX_VALUE.</code></em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p154]</span> The first paragraph of
the page (<em>However, the described approach for defining subscription
…</em>) is an eye opener gem. Given many seasoned RS users fell into
this trap at least once, a couple of paragraphs detailing these
caveats would come really handy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p169]</span> Speaking of
<code>Flux#flatMap()</code> operator, <code>concurrency</code> parameter might have been
slightly mentioned here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-question">[p171]</span> Given we are executing
<code>doOn...()</code> methods (<code>doOnNext()</code>, <code>doOnComplete()</code>,
<code>doOnSubscribe()</code>, etc.) for their side effects, what does happen
when they throw an exception?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p173]</span> Provide a couple of
examples for <code>log()</code> operator, please! Many people, particularly
coming from RxJava, do not know of its existence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-correction">[p174]</span> <em>However, this allows
forthe sending …</em> → <em>… allows for the sending …</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-question">[p174]</span> In the <code>Flux.create()</code>
example, I am puzzled about how does it handle the backpressure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p183]</span> I think <em>exponential
backoff</em> deserves an explanation here. What does it mean? Further, I
would have used seconds rather than milliseconds in the example,
since the latter does not expose the backoff periods clearly at
first sight.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-correction">[p188]</span> <em><code>Flux&lt;Integer&gt;
cachedSource = source.share();</code></em> Here and in the rest, all of the
occurences of <code>cachedSource</code> should be replaced with <code>sharedSource</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p191]</span> The used <em>assembly
phase</em> term will be described in next chapters, hence using it here
is sort of confusing. Further, the given explanation for
<code>transform()</code> has still some room for improvement. Additionally, I
would prefer to see a “when to use <code>compose()</code>, when to use
<code>transform()</code>” guide.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p196-197]</span> There are 3 places
where <em>assemble-time</em> is used, though it used to be referred as
<em>assembly-time</em>”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-correction">[p198]</span> <em>… passing
<code>Subscription</code> through ever <code>Subscriber</code>s …</em> → <em>… passing
<code>Subscription</code> through <code>Subscriber</code>s …</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-other">[p200]</span> The last paragraph of p199
goes as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>THe importance of understanding this phase is that during runtime
we may apply optimization that may reduce amount of signals
exchange. [“the amount of signals exchanged”?] For example, as we
are going to see in the next sections, we may reduce the number of
<code>Subscription#request</code> calls and improve, therefore, performance
of the stream.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Then the following tip opens the p200:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>… the invocation of <code>Subscription#request</code> method causes a write
to the <code>volatile</code> field that holds demand. Such a write is an
expensive operation from computation perspective, so it is better
to avoid it if possible.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Hrm… I thought the main overhead of <code>Subscription#request</code> calls
was unnecessary individual requests which could have been
batched. Compared to this, write to a <code>volatile</code> does not really
sound like an overhead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p200]</span> Diagram 4.8 is missing
some explanation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-question">[p204]</span> In Diagram 4.11, how is
backpressure preserved given there is an external buffer employed
by <code>publishOn</code>. Who maintains this buffer? Is it the task queue of
the <code>ScheduledExecutionService</code> used under the hood?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-question">[p206]</span> Totally lost with the
following sentence: <em>Under the hood, <code>subscribeOn</code> executes the
subscription to the parent <code>Publisher</code> into <code>Runnable</code>, which is the
scheduler for a specified <code>Scheduler</code>.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-correction">[p207]</span> In the shared code
snippet, <code>.map()</code> and <code>.filter()</code> are missing <code>...</code> as input
arguments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-question">[p208]</span> How does
<code>SingleScheduler</code> handle blocking functions spoiling time-sensitive
executions?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p209]</span> <em>… so the execution
is attache to …</em> → <em>… so the execution is attached to …</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p209]</span> In the next page, it
has been admitted that the shared code snippet does not demonstrate
a good usage of <code>ThreadLocal</code>s. So why not sharing a proper use of
<code>ThreadLocal</code>s?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-correction">[p211]</span> I think <em>Such design
decision … have its own <code>Context</code>.</em> part of the last paragraph
needs a rewrite.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-correction">[p213]</span> <em>… bottom (with id

    <p><span class="note-other">[p418]</span> This page concludes the
<em>Scaling up with Cloud Streams</em> chapter by announcing its triumph
over previously mentioned service-to-service architectures. I sadly
find this conclusion pretty biased and far from reflecting the
reality. There is no silver bullet for such problems and as has
always been the case, <em>it depends</em>. Further, almost all of the
listed so-called improvements to message broker-based solutions are
either as is or with similar approaches applicable to
service-to-service architectures as well. It is also surprising to
see no mention of practical hurdles one need to overcome while
scaling brokers too. You can easily Google and find dozens of Kafka
horror stories. For a book that spent chapters on backpressure
problems, the question of how is it affected by the delegation of
the communication to a broker is totally ignored. Given how
objective and well-equiped the authors were throughout the entire
book, I am really amazed to see such a hype-oriented conclusion at
the end of this chapter.</p>

    <p><span class="note-other">[p456]</span> I am aware of the fact that
the design of gRPC incurs <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/1549">serious flow control
problems</a>, though in
a section where you compare contenders like RSocket and gRPC, there
is no place for such a vague and ungrounded statement:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Looking at the preciding code, we may get the feeling that gRPC,
along with asynchronous message passing, gives backpressure
control support as well. However, that part is a bit tricky.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Is backpressure is not handled at all or what? One should not pass
over such a claim by hand waving.</p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="note-other">[p461]</span> The summary repeats the
triumph of message brokers over service-to-service communication one
more time. Again, this is a really subjective statement. There are
many advantages and disadvantages to each approach. Announcing a
winner is a pretty dangerous generalization.</p>

work around the problem of Spring Boot 2.0 <code>WebClient</code> not providing
the mocking support for outgoing HTTP interactions. I would rather
share this trick in a Stack Overflow post, because the readers of
the book will take it for granted, and rather share the
aforementioned WireMock approach.</p>
