<p>In a recent coding interview, I was asked to merge two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree">Binary Search Tree</a>s (BSTs) without modifying them. This was the first time I was exposed to this question and for an hour or so I tried to come up with a linear time algorithm of O(1) space complexity. The defeat was inevitable. (To tell the truth, if a hint would be given like O(m+n) storage is allowed, I could easily figure out the solution without breaking a sweat.) As usual, I could not sleep that night and scratched dozens of papers to come up with a better solution. But as night passed, I started to realize the fact that the space complexity is lower bounded by the tree height. This blog post is set to keep a cyber-record of this pursuit.</p>

<h1 id="related-work">Related Work</h1>

<p>You can first start by checking the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=merge+binary+search+tree">Google results</a>. But, as usual, I am kind enough to provide you a tl;dr version: In order to merge two BSTs of size m and n nodes, there are a couple of common approaches of fixed O(m+n) processing time and space complexity, some of which are listed as follows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Insert given BSTs into a newly created BST.</li>
  <li>Create an array of elements of the first BST in sorted order, and use this array to merge the results to a new BST while traversing the second BST.</li>
</ul>

<p>Further exposure to the higher doses of the problem is available through <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1008513/how-to-merge-two-bsts-efficiently">this</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7540546/merging-2-binary-search-trees">this</a> StackOverflow threads.</p>

<h1 id="on-complexity">On Complexity</h1>

<p>You will definitely need an O(m+n) processing complexity to visit each node, that’s for sure. But what about O(m+n) space complexity? It means that you need to store one (or both) of the given trees in a vector in order to proceed with the merge. As it will turn out in the following paragraphs, actually space complexity is lower-bounded by the height of the tree, that is, O(h), where h=logn for a balanced tree.</p>

<h1 id="the-trick">The Trick</h1>

<p>In its most basic form, we flatten both trees into two separate vectors. Next, we consume one element at a time from either of the trees with the smallest element. This scheme deserves a figure of its own.</p>

<p><img src="mn-space.jpg" alt="Solution with O(m+n) space complexity."></p>

<p>It is certain that we effectively don’t need the whole elements of a tree packed into a single vector at once. At each step, what we ask for is the next smallest element. That is, we just need a <em>stream</em> of nodes traversed in-order.</p>

<p>Let’s further investigate the possibility of implementing a stream of nodes. In order to consume the elements of a binary search tree in sorted order, we need to traverse the tree in left-center-right node order. Assume that we have below traversal function. (Yes, it is in C++ and I shamelessly used templates.)</p>

<pre><code class="language-c++"><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">traverse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Node</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;*</span> <span class="n">root</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">queue</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;&amp;</span> <span class="n">items</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">traverse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">left</span><span class="p">());</span>
    <span class="n">items</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">());</span>
    <span class="n">traverse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">right</span><span class="p">());</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre>

<p>What if I can suspend the execution at any point in time while pushing the data to a queue? In that case, what would be the maximum possible height of a recursive <code>traverse()</code> call stack? I know you like figures, so I took another photo of the board.</p>

<p><img src="tree-height.jpg" alt="Relation with tree height."></p>

<p>That is, the maximum call stack depth of a <code>traverse()</code> recursion is upper-bounded by the tree height. Coupled with the fact that successive <code>traverse()</code> calls are sufficient to consume the nodes of a tree in sorted order, we should be able to stream the nodes of tree with at most O(logn) node pointers.</p>

<h1 id="streaming-nodes">Streaming Nodes</h1>

<p>Since actual traverse call stack is bounded, we can emulate the recursive traverse using a stack of the nodes traversed so far from the root. The outline of the streaming algorithm is as follows.</p>

<p><img src="algorithm.jpg" alt="Node streaming algorithm."></p>

<h1 id="the-prestige">The Prestige</h1>

<p>Now we can stream a tree in sorted order using at most O(logn) storage. The rest is easy: Stream both trees and merge them while streaming.</p>

<h1 id="the-code">The Code</h1>

<p>I implemented a streamer (<code>NodeStream</code>), stream merger (<code>MergeNodeStream</code>), and a vector merger (<code>MergeNodeVector</code>) in C++ and Scala. Code is accessible through this <a href="https://gist.github.com/4171977">Gist</a>. You can also find implementations of the algorithm in <a href="https://gist.github.com/8be224c9cfb423dcc0f3">C++ using Boost Coroutines</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/4181097">Haskell</a> written by <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/01427008889073096042">Remko</a>.</p>
