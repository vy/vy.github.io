<p>Those who had priviledge to read my <a href="/blog/post/2017/04/18/inter-service-comm/">frustration chronicles on intra-microservice communication</a> would easily
recall me pointing my finger to Java Platform SE guys for not shipping a
proper HTTP client. There my fury went to an extent calling it as one of the
closest candidates for the billion dollar mistake. Unfortunately screaming out
loud in a blog post does not give much of a relief, because it doesn’t take
more than a month for me to find myself in precisely the same technical
mudpot. Indeed after a couple of months later I wrote that post, I was chasing
yet another performance problem in one of our aggregation services. In
essence, each incoming HTTP request is served by aggregating multiple sources
collected again over HTTP. This simple fairy tale architecture gets
slaughtered on production by 200 Tomcat threads intertwined with Rx
computation and I/O threads resting in the shades of a dozen other thread
pools dedicated for so-called-asynchronous HTTP clients for aggregated remote
services. And I saved the best for last: there were leaking <code>TIME_WAIT</code>
sockets.</p>

<p>All of a sudden the question occurred to me like the roar of rolling boulders
down a steep hill in a far distance: What is the lowest level that I can plumb
a networking application in Java without dealing with protocol intricacies.
Put another way, is there a foundational abstraction exposing both the lowest
(channel with I/O streams) and highest (HTTP headers and body) levels that are
in reach? I rode both Java OIO and NIO (that is, old- and new-I/O) horses in
the past and fell off enough to learn it the hard way that they are definitely
not feasible options in this case. The first attempt in the search of a cure
in Google introduces you to <a href="http://netty.io/">Netty</a>. If you dig long enough,
you also stumble upon <a href="http://mina.apache.org/">Apache Mina</a> too. Netty is
popular enough in the Java world that it is highly likely you are an indirect
consumer of it, unless you are already directly using it. I was aware of its
presence like dark matter in every single network application that I wrote,
though I have never considered to use it directly. Checking the Netty website
after dealing with crippled network applications at hand revealed an
enlightenment within me: <em>Hey! I can purpose this to implement some sort of
RPC mechanism using Protocol Buffers in HTTP 2.0 request payloads!</em> Though
further investigation swipes the dust from the footsteps of giants who had
followed the same path: Google (<a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a>), Facebook
(<a href="https://github.com/facebook/nifty">Nifty</a>), Twitter
(<a href="https://twitter.github.io/finagle/">Finagle</a>), etc. This finding while
crushing my first excitement, later on left its place to the confidence of
getting confirmed that I am on the right path.</p>

<p>I have always heard good things about both Netty and its community. I have
already been sneakily following the
<a href="http://normanmaurer.me/presentations/">presentations</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/normanmaurer">Twitter
updates</a> of <a href="http://normanmaurer.me/">Norman
Maurer</a>, the Netty shepherd as of date. Though what
triggered me for diving deep with Netty has become the following tweet:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Challenge accepted! First step is done. Next: Cover to cover study. <a href="https://t.co/Gnfhbi6Ko0">pic.twitter.com/Gnfhbi6Ko0</a></p>— Volkan Yazıcı (@yazicivo) <a href="https://twitter.com/yazicivo/status/954366672751689728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2018</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Norman Maurer has always been kind and encouraging to new contributors. So my
plan is to turn this into a relation with mutual benefit: I can contribute and
get tutored while doing that so.</p>

<h1 id="netty-in-action">Netty in Action</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/netty-in-action">The book</a> (2016 press date) is
definitely a must read for anyone planning to use Netty. It lays out Netty
fundamentals like channels, handlers, encoders, etc. in detail. That being
said, I have got the impression that the content is mostly curated for
beginners. For instance, dozens of pages (and an appendix) are spent (wasted?)
for a Maven crash course, not to mention the space wasted by Maven command
ouputs shared. This felt a little bit disappointing considering the existing
audience of Netty in general. Who would really read a book about Netty? You
have probably had your time with OIO/NIO primitives or client/server
frameworks in the market. You certainly don’t want to use yet another library
that promises to make all your problems disappear. So I don’t think you can be
qualified as a novice in this battle anymore, and you are indeed in the search
of a scalpel rather than a swiss army knife. Nevertheless, I still think the
book eventually managed to succeed in finding a balance between going too deep
and just scratching the surface.</p>

<h2 id="things-that-are-well-done">Things that are well done</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I really enjoyed the presented <strong>historical perspective</strong> on the development
of Java platforms’ networking facilities and Netty itself. Found it quite
valuable and wanted to read more and more!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Emphasis on <strong><code>ByteBuf</code></strong> was really handy. Later on I learnt that there are
people using Netty just for its sound <code>ByteBuf</code> implementation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost every single conscious decision within the shared <strong>code snippets are
explained in detail</strong>. While this felt like quite some noise in the
beginning, later on it turned out be really helpful – especially while
manually updating <code>ByteBuf</code> reference counts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Presented <strong>case studies</strong> were quite interesting to read and inspiring too.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="things-that-could-have-been-improved">Things that could have been improved</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I had big hopes to read about how to implement an HTTP client with
<strong>connection pool</strong> support. I particularly find this feature inevitable in a
networking application and often not consumed wisely. Though there wasn’t a
single section mentioning about connection pooling of any sort.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As someone who had studied <a href="http://normanmaurer.me/presentations/">Norman Maurer’s
presentations</a>, I was expecting to
see waaaay more practical tips about <strong>GC considerations</strong>, updating <strong>socket
options</strong> (<code>TCP_NO_DELAY</code>, <code>SO_SNDBUF</code>, <code>SO_RCVBUF</code>, <code>SO_BACKLOG</code>, etc.),
mitigating <strong><code>TIME_WAIT</code></strong> socket problems, and Netty best practices. Maybe
adding this content would have doubled the size of the book, though I still
think a book on Netty is incomplete without such practical tips.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many inbound requests trigger multiple I/O operations in a typical network
application. It is crucial to not let these operatins block a running thread,
which Netty is well aware of and hence ships a fully-fledged <code>EventExecutor</code>
abstraction. This crucial detail is mentioned in many places within the book,
though none gave a concrete example. Such a common thing could have been
demonstrated by an example.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>

<p>I always take notes while reading a book. Let it be a grammar mistake, code
typo, incorrect or ambiguous information, thought provoking know-how,
practical tip, etc. You name it. Here I will share them in page order. I will
further classify my notes in 3 groups: <span class="note-mistake">mistakes</span>,
<span class="note-improvement">improvements</span>,
<span class="note-question">questions</span>, and
<span class="note-other">other</span>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-question">[p19, Listing 2.1]</span> Why did we use
<code>ctx.writeAndFlush(Unpooled.EMPTY_BUFFER)</code>   rather than just calling
<code>ctx.flush()</code>?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-mistake">[p21, Listing 2.2]</span> Typo in
<code>throws Exceptio3n</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p49, Section 4.3.1]</span>
The listed items</p>

    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>A new <code>Channel</code> was accepted and is ready.</li>
        <li>A <code>Channel</code> connection …</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <p>are an identical repetition of Table 4.3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p60]</span> <code>CompositeByteBuf</code> has the
following remark:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Note that Netty optimizes socket I/O operations that employ
<code>CompositeByteBuf</code>, eliminating whenever possible the performance and
memory usage penalties that are incurred with JDK’s buffer implementation.
This optimization takes place in Netty’s core code and is therefore not
exposed, but you should be aware of its impact.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Interesting. Good to know. I should be aware of <em>its impact</em>. But how can
I measure and relate this impact? Maybe I am just nitpicking, tough I would
love to hear a little bit more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-question">[p77, Table 6.3]</span>
<code>channelWritabilityChanged()</code> method of <code>ChannelInboundHandler</code>… How come
an inbound channel can have a writability notion? I would have expected an
inbound channel to be just readable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p78, Section 6.1.4]</span> Starts with
some really intriguing paragraph:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A powerful capability of <code>ChannelOutboundHandler</code> is to defer an operation
or event on demand, which allows for sophisticated approaches to request
handling. If writing to the remote peer is suspended, for example, you can
defer flush operations and resume them later.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Though it ends here. No more explanations, not even a single example, etc.
A total mystery.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-question">[p79, Table 6.4]</span> <code>read()</code> method of a
<code>ChannelOutboundHandler</code>… Similar to <code>ChannelInboundHandler#channelWritabilityChanged()</code>,
how come an outbound channel can have a read method? What are we reading
that is supposed to be already originating from us and destined to a remote
peer?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p79, Section 6.1.4]</span>
It goes as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong><code>ChannelPromise</code> vs. <code>ChannelFuture</code></strong> Most of the methods in
<code>ChannelOutboutHandler</code> take a <code>ChannelPromise</code> argument to be notified
when the operation completes. <code>ChannelPromise</code> is a subinterface of
<code>ChannelFuture</code> that defines the writable methods, such as <code>setSuccess()</code>
or <code>setFailure()</code>, thus making <code>ChannelFuture</code> immutable.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Ok, but why? I know the difference between a <code>Future</code> and a <code>Promise</code>, though
I still cannot see the necessity for outbound handlers to employ <code>Promise</code>
instead of a <code>Future</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-question">[p84, Listing 6.5]</span> While adding handlers
to a pipeline, what happens in the case of a name conflict?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p84]</span> A remark is dropped on the
<strong><code>ChannelHandler</code> execution and blocking</strong> subject. Just in time! Though
it misses a demonstration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-question">[p86, Listing 6.9]</span> Again a <code>read()</code>
method for the outbound operations of a <code>ChannelPipeline</code>. I am really
puzzled on the notion of reading from an outbound channel.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-question">[p94, Listing 6.13]</span> What happens when
a <code>ChannelFuture</code> completes before adding a listener to it?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-mistake">[p95, Section 6.5]</span> Last paragraph goes
like this:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The next chapter will focus on Netty’s codec abstraction, which makes
writing protocol encoders and decoders much easier than using the
underlying <code>ChannelHandler</code> implementations directly.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Though next chapter focuses on <code>EventLoop</code> and threading model.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-question">[p102, Listing 7.3]</span> Speaking of
scheduling <code>Runnable</code>s to a channel’s event loop, what if channel gets
closed before triggering the scheduled tasks?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p103]</span> Page starts with the
following last paragraph:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>These examples illustrate the performance gain that can be achieved
by taking advantage of Netty’s scheduling capabilities.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Really? Netty’s scheduling capabilities are shown by using each function in
isolation. Though I still don’t have a clue on how these capabilities can be
purposed for a performance gain. This is a <strong>common problem throughout the
book</strong>: The innocent flashy statement hangs in the air, waiting for a
demonstration that shares some insight distilled by experience.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-mistake">[p104, Figure 7.4]</span> The caption of figure
is as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><code>EventLoop</code> allocation for non-blocking transports (such as NIO and AIO)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>AIO? Looks like a typo.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-mistake">[p107]</span> Chapter starts with the following
opening paragraph:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Having studied <code>ChannelPipeline</code>s, <code>ChannelHandler</code>s, and codec classes in
depth, …</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Nope. Nothing has been mentioned so far about codec classes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p112]</span> It is explained that, in the
context of <code>Bootstrap</code>, <code>bind()</code>   and <code>connect()</code> can throw
<code>IllegalStateException</code> if some combination of   <code>group()</code>, <code>channel()</code>,
<code>channelHandler()</code>, and/or <code>handler()</code> method calls   is missing. Similarly,
calling <code>attr()</code> after <code>bind()</code> has no effect. I personally find such
abstractions poorly designed. I would rather have used the <a href="https://immutables.github.io/immutable.html#staged-builder">staged builder
pattern</a> and
avoid such intricacies at compile-time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-mistake">[p117, Listing 8.6]</span> The 2nd argument to
<code>Bootstrap#group()</code> looks like a typo.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p120]</span> Check this end of chapter
summary out:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In this chapter you learned how to bootstrap Netty server and client
applications, including those that use connectionless protocols. We
covered a number of special cases, including bootstrapping client channels
in server applications and using a <code>ChannelInitializer</code> to handle the
installation of multiple <code>ChannelHandler</code>s during bootstrapping. You saw
how to specify configuration options on channels and how to attach
information to a channel using attributes. Finally, you learned how to
shut down an application gracefully to release all resources in an
orderly fashion.</p>

      <p>In the next chapter we’ll examine the tools Netty provides to help you
test your <code>ChannelHandler</code> implementations.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I have always found such summaries useless, since it is a repetition of
the chapter introduction, and hence a waste of space. Rather just
give crucial take aways, preferably in a digestible at a glimpse form.
For instance, <em>use <code>EventLoopGroup.shutdownGracefully()</code></em>, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p121]</span> I suppose <em>Unit Testing</em>
chapter used to come after <em>Codecs</em> in previous prints and the authors
have moved it to an earlier stage to establish a certain coherence in
the introductory chapters. Though, reading <em>Codecs</em> reveals that there
is close to 70% overlap in content, which feels like a poorly structured
flow. I see the value in authors’ attempt, though there is quite some
room for improvement via tuning the break down of chapters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-mistake">[p124, Section 9.2.1]</span>
<code>ByteToMessageDecoder</code> is used before explained. (See my remark above.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="note-improvement">[p127]</span> The following bullets</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Before <a href="https://github.com/facebook/nifty">Nifty</a>, many of our major Java
services at Facebook used an older, custom NIO-based Thrift server
implementation that works similarly to Nifty. That implementation is an
older codebase that had more time to mature, but because its asynchronous
I/O handling code was built from scratch, and because Nifty is built on
the solid foundation of Netty’s asynchronous I/O framework, it has had
many fewer problems.</p>

      <p>One of our custom message queuing services had been built using the older
framework, and it started to suffer from a kind of socket leak. A lot of
connections were sitting around in <code>CLOSE_WAIT</code> state, meaning the server
had received a notification that the client had closed the socket, but the
server never reciprocated by making its own call to close the socket. This
left the sockets in a kind of <code>CLOSE_WAIT</code> limbo.</p>

      <p>The problem happened very slowly; across the entire pool of machines
handling this service, there might be millions of requests per second,
but usually only one socket on one server would enter this state in an
hour. It wasn’t an urgent issue because it took a long time before a
server needed a restart at that rate, but it also complicated tracking
down the cause. Extensive digging through the code didn’t help much
either: initially several places looked suspicious, but everything
ultimately checked out and we didn’t locate the problem.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In summary, <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/netty-in-action">Netty in Action</a>
is a book that I would recommend to everyone who wants to learn more about
Netty to use it in their applications. Almost the entire set of fundamental
Netty abstractions are covered in detail. The content is a bliss for novice
users in networking domain. Though this in return might make the book
uninteresting for people who already got their hands pretty dirty with
networking facilities available in Java Platform. That being said, the
presented historical perspective and shared case studies are still pretty
attractive even for the most advanced users.</p>

<p>I don’t know much about the 2<sup>nd</sup> author of the book, Marvin Allen
Wolfthal. Though, the 1<sup>st</sup> author, Norman Maurer, is a pretty known
figure in the F/OSS ecosystem. If he manages to transfer more juice from his
experience and presentations to the book, I will definitely buy the
2<sup>nd</sup> print of the book too!</p>
