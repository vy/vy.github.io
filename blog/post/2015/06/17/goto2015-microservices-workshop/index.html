<p>Today I have attended to the
<a href="http://gotocon.com/amsterdam-2015/presentations/show_presentation.jsp?oid=6678">Microservices</a>
workshop by <a href="https://twitter.com/fgeorge52">Fred George</a> in <a href="http://gotocon.com/amsterdam-2015/">GOTO
2015</a>. For captain’s diary, here I will
try to briefly write down the highlights of the session along with my personal
take aways.</p>

<h1 id="about-fred-george">About Fred George</h1>

<p>He is definitely the right guy for the advocacy of the microservice
architectures. He stated that, throughout his entire programming career, he
had involved in various software projects where he had chance to employ
microservice systems. Further, he had many failures (most of the time not
related with the software itself) and some notable achievements that turned
into million dollar success stories.</p>

<p>Personally, I found him a little bit biased about microservices – which could
very well be due to my inexperience in this field compared to his. That is, he
almost approaches every problem from a microservice perspective, which reminds
me that everything looks like a nail when you have a hammer in your hand.
Nevertheless, this might also be necessiated from the problems he had been
thrown at. From what I understood, most of the time he is exposed to teams
which already have a significant amount of code base and is asked to break it
into reusable and self-contained components, which he eventually molded into
yet another microservice architecture.</p>

<h1 id="defining-a-microservice">Defining a Microservice</h1>

<p>He has an inclination to put almost every functionality into a microservice
which exceeds 100 lines of code! And by <em>microservice</em>, most of the time he
refers to a bus architecture. This puzzled me quite a bit. I mean, there are
many other ways to build an inter-service communication channel and apperantly
he had designed such systems in the past too. But somehow in this workshop he
prefered to stick with bus architectures for some reason I could not really
understand.</p>

<h1 id="rapids-rivers-and-ponds">Rapids, Rivers, and Ponds</h1>

<p>He categorizes a microservice architecture into three layers as follows.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The uppermost layer is called <em>rapids</em>. Every microservice writes (not
reads!) to this bus. He prefers to realize this layer with a persistent
message bus like <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a>.</li>
  <li>The middle layer is called <em>rivers</em>, which is realized by a non-persisting
bus (where <a href="http://zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a> is his personal choice) filtering
on themed events from <em>rapids</em>. Microservices are expected to read from
rivers. Note that he also uses a microservice to hook up every river to
rapids bus.</li>
  <li>At the bottom there are <em>ponds</em>. Here the history/state of events and
entities are kept. Ponds are again provided by microservices that
internally interface to a (No)SQL storage component.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="rapids-rivers-ponds.svg" alt="Microservices: Rapids, Rivers, and Ponds"></p>

<p>I found this layering approach surprisingly enlightening. Though it still
contains some parts that puzzle me, I believe those question marks are mainly
project specific components that can be (should be?) completed during the
development of the system.</p>

<h1 id="messaging-medium">Messaging Medium</h1>

<p>According to his experiences, most of the time the message size and its
(de)serialization costs do not rank the top priority in terms of overall
system performance. Hence, he had always sticked with JSON and is so far
really happy with the outcome. We even had a small discussion about
<a href="https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/">Disruptor</a> and
<a href="http://www.lmax.com/">L-MAX</a>. He had told that he had chance to work with
some really talented programmers in L-MAX and stated that problems they were
tackling over there in finance world is quite some different from the ones
addressed in ordinary software industry.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.bol.com/">bol.com</a>, our definition of a microservice can be
described in three main components:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>server</em> – accessible by REST via a multitude of protocols: JSON, XML, and
protobuf. It can either be a J2EE application or a self-contained Docker
image.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>api</em> – exposes entities for the programming language, which is 99% of the
time in Java.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>driver</em> – provides Java-friendly function calls to the <em>server</em> using
<em>api</em> models. The caller does not need to worry about the messaging format,
REST call mechanics, or the protocol version.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Hence, it is not possible to write a 100 LOC microservice here, which makes
totally sense in my opinion. On the contrary, Fred George just passes around a
JSON object where both ends need to eat their own dog food in order to
parse/create messages. Here I found Fred’s approach resembling a prototype for
a feasibility examination rather than a final product. Personally, I did not
buy his reasoning on this issue.</p>

<h1 id="unit-and-acceptance-tests">Unit and Acceptance Tests</h1>

<p>Let me quote directly from Fred George’s slides:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>self-monitoring services replaces unit tests</li>
    <li>business monitoring replaces acceptance tests</li>
    <li>monitor live system continuously rather than testing</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>His reasoning for the above points was a microservice composed of 100 LOC
should be simple enough to not necessitate any tests at all. Monitoring live
system would expose any potential bugs and with rapid deployments you can
easily fix it on production. To say the least, I do not agree.</p>

<h1 id="programming-languages">Programming Languages</h1>

<p>He prefers dynamicly-typed languages to build microservices. I think this also
emanetes from the fact that he just passes around a JSON object with no
certain schema and language-specific driver implementation. This eventually
necessitates him to write his JSON reader/writer for each microservice, where
dynamically-typed languages play well. Again, I do not agree. I mean, solving
the problem of ad-hoc parsing via a dynamically-typed language, I think, just
solves the problem of a prevoiusly given wrong decision: You have neither
drivers, nor a contract in the message format.</p>

<p>He also talked about how he believes Clojure is very suitable for
microservices and Elixir is also a promising language in the field without
giving any actual facts. I mean, why? Why Clojure and why not Groovy? I
honestly found it really annoying that he presents his personal taste as
facts without providing any actual rationale or context. While I am a big fan
of Lisp family of languages and also Erlang/Elixir, I found this part of the
presentation totally non-sense.</p>

<h1 id="the-tooling-for-microservices">The Tooling for Microservices</h1>

<p>He also complained about the required free and open source tooling for
microservices are not there yet, but it is very close. He stated that</p>

<ul>
  <li>NodeJS community is doing really good work in this field,</li>
  <li>Netflix released really good software building blocks (which I also agree),</li>
  <li>Cassandra helps to get better microservices (WTF!),</li>
  <li>Docker plays a milestone in the microservice history, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>While I totally agree with some points, playing around with buzzwords like
NodeJS, Cassandra… I found it amusing. He also added that there is still not
a single good book on microservices. Nope! He did not accept service-oriented
architecture books in the literature as an answer.</p>

<h1 id="the-workshop">The Workshop</h1>

<p>So what did we really do in the workshop? We wrote a couple of basic
microservices, where we employ a JSON object as a messaging medium and a
central RabbitMQ server as the bus. (Fun fact: Wi-Fi sucked as usual. Fred
George was experienced enough to bring his own access point.)</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Fred George apparently has a vast amount of experience in the field of
microservice architectures. I really liked the <em>Rapids, Rivers, and Ponds</em>
design of a bus-oriented system. He had also shared some really interesting
software development experiences he had in the past, which also provided
further clues on potential pitfalls and exceptions. Nevertheless, I found his
JSON-passing approach (where each microservice needs to implement its own
reader/writer) not solid enough and I did not buy his facts on rationale
behind this. Further, relating the microservice architectures with a
particular language or tool was absolutely awkward, to say the least.</p>
