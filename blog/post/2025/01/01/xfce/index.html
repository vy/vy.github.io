<p><a href="https://xfce.org">Xfce</a> has been my primary desktop environment (DE) since the mid-2000s, for both personal and professional use.
Even though hazy, I have recollections of life without Thunar, migration to GTK 3, and other age-disclosing historical milestones.
I even <a href="/blog/post/2015/01/01/xubuntu-on-macbookpro/">used Xfce on a MacBook Pro (2015) for several years</a>.
Contrary to my earlier flirts (<a href="https://www.windowmaker.org/">WindowMaker</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbox">Blackbox</a>, which was later succeeded by <a href="https://fluxbox.org/">Fluxbox</a>), I haven’t really configured Xfce much either—the defaults were mostly satisfactory.</p>

<p>After more than two decades of usage, I can confidently say <strong>Xfce has been the most boring desktop environment I have ever used</strong>.
It has been through several heart surgeries, ranging from rewrites to GTK major version upgrades, yet I haven’t noticed a single bump.
New DEs flourished, and primary players (GNOME &amp; KDE) got substantial financial and development-resource reinforcements.
The harvest was a frenzy of mind-blowing, fancy new <em>user-visible</em> DE features: tiling windows, 3D cube/zoomed workspace transitions, animations, macOS-like looks, etc.
In the meantime, <strong>Xfce had hardly any new user-visible changes</strong>.
It is as boring as it was at its inception; a panel at the top, and… and… yeah, pretty much nothing else — and <strong>I love it</strong>.</p>

<p>I myself work on some, mostly open-source, decades-old, massively used software (OpenJDK, Log4j, etc.) on a daily basis.
A mind-blowing effort goes into keeping such systems stable (i.e., backward compatibility), evaluating and integrating new features, and striking a good balance between the two.
Looking at things from this angle, I cannot express my gratitude enough to the Xfce developers for enabling me to carry out my daily routines with a well-thought-out, small set of basic features, and for keeping them running and up-to-date under the hood with almost no user-visible changes.
I want to thank all its <em>maintainers</em>, people who mostly do the dirty plumbing work instead of running after every new shiny thing in the market.
I want them to know they have users who are not distro-hoppers, toy-project developers, home-automation enthusiasts, or retro-computer lovers, but who deliver serious work using Xfce in their day-to-day jobs.</p>

<h1 id="developer-laptops--linux">Developer laptops &amp; Linux</h1>

<p>I’ve never worked at an employer where Linux was officially recognized as a developer-laptop OS.
I always needed to roll up my sleeves and walk the unbeaten path: learn how things (VPN, OTP, etc.) work on macOS/Windows and try to reproduce them on Linux.
This initial setup has mostly been, even though rewarding, time-consuming.
But I got pretty good at it over the years, and I hardly get surprised anymore.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to observe macOS/Windows developers, and the sheer extent of effort they put into problems that have been solved by Linux decades ago.
They need to install a package manager, a third-party application to define key bindings, and they need to stare at a screen for several minutes during a system upgrade that happens once a month or so, and so on.
These observations just strengthened my respect and love for the Linux &amp; Xfce setup.</p>

<p>What does all this have to do with Xfce?
Well, Xfce has just always worked for me.
VPN clients, IDEs, and everything I use to carry out my daily tasks worked out of the box.
Xfce simply never stood in the way, and I think that is pretty awesome.
In contrast, applications with dialog windows or taskbar interactions have always been problematic for me with other window managers.</p>

<h1 id="the-working-setup">The working setup</h1>

<p>I would like to take this opportunity to <s>brag about</s> share details of my personal setup.
My goal in doing so is to provide a perspective to maintainers on what users matching my profile care about.</p>
