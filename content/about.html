				I am a programmer living in the Netherlands. I have a BS in
				math, an MS and PhD in CS. Right now I am working as software
				engineer at <a href="https://bol.com/">bol.com</a> &dash; the
				largest e-commerce platform in the Netherlands and Belgium.
				Sometimes in parallel with my education, sometimes as a
				full-time employee, I worked in several industrial projects
				ranging from embedded systems programming to database
				administration, mobile asset tracking to enterprise Java
				application development. I have work experience with C, Common
				Lisp, Java, PostgreSQL, Scala and spent significant amount of
				time with CoffeeScript, Hazelcast, JavaScript, JGroups,
				OpenFlow (i.e., Beacon, Floodlight, FlowVisor and OpenFlowJ).
				In addition, I used AngularJS, C++, ExpressJS, Erlang,
				Haskell, Meteor, MongoDB, NodeJS, OCaml, RailwayJS, Scheme in
				personal projects. You can send me an <a
				href="mailto:volkan.yazici@gmail.com">e-mail</a> and follow me
				on <a href="https://twitter.com/yazicivo">Twitter</a> and <a
