This week I took the stage at [bol.com](//bol.com) with a presentation titled
*The State of Lightweight Threads for the JVM*. The abstract of the presentation
was as follows:

> Thanks to your constantly crashing desktop apps, you know about processes.
> Microservice flavored web development taught us about threads too. Then came
> callbacks, shortening lifetime of millions of developers. Do you recall the day
> you shed tears when Java shipped a Future that you can complete? I know you
> haven't forgotten how Reactive Streams occupied our agendas with RxJava,Reactor,
> and infinite stack traces. Now newspapers are yelling about coroutines, fibers,
> lightweight threads! We poor souls... In this presentation, I aimto give a
> 2,000ft overview of where do we come from, where are we heading to, and what
> does all this mean for the Java Virtual Machine, aka, JVM. Are you a Java
> developer? Thread circus owner? Reactive ninja? Kotlin fan? COBOL enthusiast?
> Algol pensioner? There is something I will tell you. (Spoiler: I will as well
> talk about Project Loom, structured concurrency, and scoped variables.)

The slides are available in [PDF](loom-bol.pdf) and
[ODP](loom-bol-org.odp) formats.
